## How They Link Without Nameserver Changes

### Step 1: User Types URL
```
User → Browser → "weatherwise.earth"
```

### Step 2: DNS Lookup
```
Browser asks: "Where is weatherwise.earth?"
↓
Your registrar's nameservers respond:
"Check the DNS records..."
↓
Finds A record: @ → 76.76.21.21
```

### Step 3: Connection
```
Browser connects to IP: 76.76.21.21
↓
That IP belongs to Vercel's servers
```

### Step 4: Vercel Routes Request
```
Vercel receives request for "weatherwise.earth"
↓
Checks which project owns this domain
↓
Finds: weatherwiseplanner project
↓
Serves your app! ✅
```

## The Link is Through DNS Records, NOT Nameservers!

### Nameservers Stay With Registrar:
```
weatherwise.earth
  ↓
Nameservers: ns1.namecheap.com (or wherever you bought it)
  ↓
These control WHERE to look up DNS records
  ↓
STAY at your registrar - DON'T CHANGE
```

### DNS Records Point to Vercel:
```
DNS Records (managed at your registrar):
  - www → cname.vercel-dns.com (CNAME)
  - @ → 76.76.21.21 (A Record)
  ↓
These tell WHERE the website is hosted
  ↓
POINT to Vercel - ADD THESE
```

## Summary

| Thing | What to Do | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| **Nameservers** | ❌ Don't change | They're fine where they are |
| **DNS Records** | ✅ Add 2 records | This links your domain to Vercel |
| **Domain** | ✅ Stays with registrar | You keep ownership |
| **Website** | ✅ Hosted on Vercel | Served from Vercel's servers |

## In Plain English

Think of it like this:

**Nameservers** = The phone book company  
**DNS Records** = Individual phone numbers in the book  
**Your Domain** = Your phone number  
**Vercel** = Where calls get forwarded to

You're just adding a forwarding number in YOUR phone book (DNS record).  
You're NOT changing phone companies (nameservers).

✅ **Result: weatherwise.earth works, nothing breaks, setup takes 5 minutes!**
