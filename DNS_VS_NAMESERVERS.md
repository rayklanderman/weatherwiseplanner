# DNS Setup Options for weatherwise.earth on Vercel

## ❓ Do I Need to Change Nameservers?

**Short Answer: NO!** ✅

You have **TWO options** - adding DNS records is easier and recommended.

---

## Option 1: Add DNS Records (RECOMMENDED) ⭐

### What You Do:
- ✅ Keep your current nameservers (wherever you bought the domain)
- ✅ Just add 2-3 DNS records in your registrar's DNS settings
- ✅ Domain stays with your registrar, only website points to Vercel

### Pros:
- ✅ Super easy (5 minutes)
- ✅ Keep email, other services intact
- ✅ No risk of breaking anything
- ✅ Can use other DNS records (email, subdomains, etc.)

### Cons:
- ❌ None really!

### How It Works:
```
Your Domain Registrar (Namecheap/GoDaddy/etc.)
   ↓
Nameservers: registrar's nameservers (NO CHANGE)
   ↓
DNS Records: Add CNAME pointing to Vercel
   ↓
When someone visits weatherwise.earth:
   1. DNS looks up weatherwise.earth
   2. Finds CNAME → cname.vercel-dns.com
   3. Browser goes to Vercel
   4. Vercel serves your app ✅
```

### What to Add:
```dns
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com

Type: A (or ALIAS/ANAME if supported)
Name: @
Value: 76.76.21.21
```

That's it! No nameserver changes needed.

## Option 2: Change Nameservers to Vercel (OPTIONAL)

### What You Do:
- Change your domain's nameservers to Vercel's nameservers
- All DNS management moves to Vercel
- More control for Vercel, but more complex

### Pros:
- ✅ Slightly faster DNS resolution
- ✅ Manage everything in one place (Vercel dashboard)
- ✅ Vercel handles all DNS automatically

### Cons:
- ❌ More complex setup
- ❌ Breaks email if you have email@weatherwise.earth
- ❌ All DNS must be managed in Vercel (not your registrar)
- ❌ Overkill for just a website

### How It Works:
```
Your Domain Registrar
   ↓
Change Nameservers to: ns1.vercel-dns.com, ns2.vercel-dns.com
   ↓
All DNS queries go to Vercel
   ↓
Vercel manages everything
```

### When to Use This:
- Only if you want Vercel to manage ALL DNS (email, subdomains, everything)
- NOT recommended unless you have a specific reason

---

## Recommended: Option 1 (DNS Records Only)

### Step-by-Step for DNS Records:

#### 1. **Find Your Domain Registrar's DNS Settings**

Where you bought weatherwise.earth determines where you add DNS records:

**Namecheap:**
```
Login → Dashboard → Manage → Advanced DNS
```

**GoDaddy:**
```
Login → My Products → DNS → Manage Zones
```

**Google Domains / Squarespace:**
```
Login → My domains → weatherwise.earth → DNS
```

**Cloudflare:**
```
Login → Select domain → DNS
```

#### 2. **Add These DNS Records:**

**Record 1 - WWW subdomain:**
```
Type: CNAME
Host/Name: www
Value/Points to: cname.vercel-dns.com
TTL: Automatic (or 3600)
```

**Record 2 - Root domain (choose based on what your registrar supports):**

**If your registrar has ANAME/ALIAS (Namecheap, Cloudflare, DNSimple):**
```
Type: ANAME (or ALIAS)
Host/Name: @
Value/Points to: cname.vercel-dns.com
TTL: Automatic (or 3600)
```

**If your registrar only has A records (GoDaddy, most others):**
```
Type: A
Host/Name: @
Value/Points to: 76.76.21.21
TTL: Automatic (or 3600)
```

#### 3. **Save Changes**
- Click Save/Add Record
- Wait 5-30 minutes for DNS to propagate

#### 4. **Verify in Vercel**
```
Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Domains
→ Click "Refresh" next to weatherwise.earth
→ Should show "Valid Configuration" ✅
```

## What About Nameservers?

### Current Nameservers (Don't Change!)

When you bought weatherwise.earth, it came with default nameservers like:

**Namecheap:**
```
ns1.namecheap.com
ns2.namecheap.com
```

**GoDaddy:**
```
ns01.domaincontrol.com
ns02.domaincontrol.com
```

**Cloudflare:**
```
ns1.cloudflare.com
ns2.cloudflare.com
```

**→ Keep these! Don't change them!**

### Where Are Nameservers?

Most registrars show them:
```
Domain Settings → Nameservers → Currently using: [...]
```

**You'll see something like:**
```
✅ Use default nameservers (KEEP THIS SELECTED)
or
✅ Custom nameservers: ns1.example.com (KEEP AS-IS)
```

**DO NOT select:**
```
❌ Change to custom nameservers
❌ Transfer DNS
❌ Use different nameservers
```

## How DNS Records Link to Vercel

### The Magic of CNAME Records:

```
User types: www.weatherwise.earth
   ↓
1. DNS lookup: "What IP is www.weatherwise.earth?"
   ↓
2. Your registrar's DNS server says: 
   "www is a CNAME to cname.vercel-dns.com"
   ↓
3. DNS looks up: "What IP is cname.vercel-dns.com?"
   ↓
4. Vercel's DNS says: "Use IPs: 76.76.21.21, 76.76.19.88, etc."
   ↓
5. Browser connects to that IP
   ↓
6. Vercel's server receives request
   ↓
7. Vercel checks: "Which project owns weatherwise.earth?"
   ↓
8. Vercel serves YOUR app! ✅
```

### The A Record (for root domain):

```
User types: weatherwise.earth (no www)
   ↓
1. DNS lookup: "What IP is weatherwise.earth?"
   ↓
2. Your registrar's DNS says: "It's 76.76.21.21"
   ↓
3. Browser connects to 76.76.21.21
   ↓
4. Vercel's server at that IP receives request
   ↓
5. Vercel checks hostname header: "weatherwise.earth"
   ↓
6. Vercel serves YOUR app! ✅
```

## FAQ

### Q: Will my email stop working?
**A:** No! Email uses different DNS records (MX records). Adding CNAME/A for your website won't affect email.

### Q: Can I use subdomains like api.weatherwise.earth?
**A:** Yes! Add more CNAME records pointing different subdomains wherever you want.

### Q: What if I already use Cloudflare for DNS?
**A:** Perfect! Just add the records in Cloudflare. Turn OFF the orange proxy cloud (use gray/DNS only).

### Q: How long does DNS take to propagate?
**A:** Usually 5-30 minutes, but can take up to 48 hours. Check progress at dnschecker.org

### Q: Do I need to verify domain ownership?
**A:** Vercel verifies automatically when DNS points to them. No TXT records needed.

### Q: Can I still manage DNS at my registrar?
**A:** Yes! That's the whole point of Option 1. You keep full DNS control.
